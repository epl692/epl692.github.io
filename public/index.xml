      <description>Well, how about today. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice blue green day today and I&amp;rsquo;m actally trying to be outside. Had a cup of tea this morning. Rather enjoying this. As for projects, I think I am going to work on my ferrissay cli app today. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly a jumble of cargo crates, but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting learning it. I&amp;rsquo;ll post more about it when it&amp;rsquo;s more ready. Currently it only greets people, I would like it to be more like cowsay when it&amp;rsquo;s done.</description>

      <description>I seem to have misplaced the old blog, so here&amp;rsquo;s a new one. What&amp;rsquo;s new with Eric? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m learning rust, been playing with Kotlin a little. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling a little better I think. There&amp;rsquo;s always the eb and flow to all of it. I look forward to seeing how things go. On the radio front, I continue to run my packet bbs station, and have been messaging people with that.</description>
