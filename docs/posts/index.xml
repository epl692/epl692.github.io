      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, this is going to be a somewhat personal post, but first, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you some tech updates. I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to rewire the home network. It&amp;rsquo;s gotten a little convoluted over time and I just think it needs a spruce up. We will so what I can come up with, but I have some hopes for it. Just like getting rewired myself. Tomorrow morning I see a Doctor about loosing some weight. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit apprehensive but we will see. If all goes well, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a few weeks to sit with my computer and write some code or something. Or hop on the airwaves&amp;hellip; or maybe get around to writing a plugin for LinBPQ like I always thought would be fun&amp;hellip; that would allow me to program and get on the airwaves. All for now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, how about today. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice blue green day today and I&amp;rsquo;m actally trying to be outside. Had a cup of tea this morning. Rather enjoying this. As for projects, I think I am going to work on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/epl692/ferrissay/&#34;&gt;ferrissay&lt;/a&gt; cli app today. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly a jumble of cargo crates, but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting learning it. I&amp;rsquo;ll post more about it when it&amp;rsquo;s more ready. Currently it only greets people, I would like it to be more like cowsay when it&amp;rsquo;s done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I seem to have misplaced the old blog, so here&amp;rsquo;s a new one. What&amp;rsquo;s new with Eric? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m learning rust, been playing with Kotlin a little. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling a little better I think. There&amp;rsquo;s always the eb and flow to all of it. I look forward to seeing how things go. On the radio front, I continue to run my packet bbs station, and have been messaging people with that. If you want to say hi, I&amp;rsquo;m ke8gry on Winlink.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
