I'm excited to say that the ULS reflects my new ham radio license status as an extra. I passed over the weekend and am excited about that. It's been a goal for a while, so I'm not sure what to do now that I've achieved it. I think I will need to try using my new privileges, and check out if my HF radio antenna still works in the snow. I've been on UHF/VHF, but my HF rig has been dormant for a while, due to lack of time, and focus on other things.

Maybe with Christmas break coming up, I can get on the radio some more! That would be fun. Gotta try out a few new things, right?

sMy wife and daughter will be trying for their licenses in March, I think. We will see!
