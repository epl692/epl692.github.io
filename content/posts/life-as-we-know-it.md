Well, this is going to be a somewhat personal post, but first, I'll give you some tech updates. I think I'm going to rewire the home network. It's gotten a little convoluted over time and I just think it needs a spruce up. We will so what I can come up with, but I have some hopes for it. Just like getting rewired myself. Tomorrow morning I see a Doctor about loosing some weight. I'm a bit apprehensive but we will see. If all goes well, I'll have a few weeks to sit with my computer and write some code or something. Or hop on the airwaves... or maybe get around to writing a plugin for LinBPQ like I always thought would be fun... that would allow me to program and get on the airwaves. All for now.
