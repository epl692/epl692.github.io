# And We're back!
And we are back from that... interesting break.
Rumors of me giving up blogging are greatly exaggerated, and I'm back! Previously mentioned weight loss doctor visit went well, I'm much lighter now. I've gone almost exclusively Linux at this point, and feel like I'm much more creative these days than I used to be. At least I try.

# Looking Forward to 2026
Some projects I want to try in 2026:
  - Design a Pebble watchface with some heart rate monitoring built in.
  - I have a web app I am starting to work on for myself.
  
  I guess that's just the start to it.

  Life Goals for 2026?
   - Take a breather
   - Try something new

Anyways... till next.
