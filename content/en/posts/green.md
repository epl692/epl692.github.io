Well, how about today. It's a nice blue green day today and I'm actally trying to be outside. Had a cup of tea this morning. Rather enjoying this. As for projects, I think I am going to work on my [ferrissay](https://github.com/epl692/ferrissay/) cli app today. It's mainly a jumble of cargo crates, but it's interesting learning it. I'll post more about it when it's more ready. Currently it only greets people, I would like it to be more like cowsay when it's done.

That's all for this morning.
