I seem to have misplaced the old blog, so here's a new one. What's new with Eric? Well, I'm learning rust, been playing with Kotlin a little. Personally, I've been feeling a little better I think. There's always the eb and flow to all of it. I look forward to seeing how things go. On the radio front, I continue to run my packet bbs station, and have been messaging people with that. If you want to say hi, I'm ke8gry on Winlink.
